<TD>python: Virtual environment (venv) activation scripts don&#39;t quote paths</TD>
<TD>A vulnerability has been found in the CPython `venv` module and CLI where path names provided when creating a virtual environment were not quoted properly, allowing the creator to inject commands into virtual environment &quot;activation&quot; scripts (ie &quot;source venv/bin/activate&quot;). This means that attacker-controlled virtual environments are able to run commands when the virtual environment is activated. Virtual environments which are not created by an attacker or which aren&#39;t activated before being used (ie &quot;./venv/bin/python&quot;) are not affected.</TD>

<TD>vim: use-after-free when closing buffers in Vim</TD>
<TD>Vim is an open source, command line text editor. A use-after-free was found in Vim &lt; 9.1.0764. When closing a buffer (visible in a window) a BufWinLeave auto command can cause an use-after-free if this auto command happens to re-open the same buffer in a new split window. Impact is low since the user must have intentionally set up such a strange auto command and run some buffer unload commands. However this may lead to a crash. This issue has been addressed in version 9.1.0764 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</TD>
